# CrashServer ðŸ’¥

An implementation of an upstream collection server for the [Google Crashpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/) crash handler. Intended to be as an all-in-one setup for small-to-medium projects who want to ability to:

- Store symbols and decode minidumps for separate projects
- View a list of recent crashes for any given project
- Allow for minidump upload from a public webpage

Built for open-source projects that use Google Crashpad, and want to host their own crash collection server.
